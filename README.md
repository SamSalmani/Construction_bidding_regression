# Construction_bidding_regression
In this project, based on the dataset provided by Department of Transportation (DoT), I wanted to define a logistic regression model to predict if a bidding process is collusive or not. There are some criteria defined in order to investigate whether a bidding process is healthy including the number of bids in each bidding process, the percentage of the money allocated to traffic control in each bid, and the ratio of the minimum bid to the DoT estimate. Call parameter in the dataset shows whether a bidding process was collusive or not. If call is equal to 1, it means that the process was collusive.
